# ayih

## Game Description
This is a chess-like game with a "Karate" theme.  Each side starts with 3 samurai,
3 ninjas, 3 mini-samurai, 3 mini-ninjas, and a King.  It is played on a 7x8 board,
and players "attack" opposing pieces by moving one of their pieces in front of
an opponents piece.  When a piece is attacked, it is "demoted".  When a "mini"
piece is attacked, it is removed from the board.  The king cannot move, and if it
is attacked, then that side loses. The player will play against my program "ayih".

## Development
Ayih was written in C++. I developed this game in my AI class.

## Run
Run the exe on Linux.
